Project Requirements Proposal: Antigravity Application
Version: 1.0 Document Type: System Architecture & Pedagogical Design Specification
1. Executive Mission
Objective: To build a "Cognitive Scaffolding Engine" that actively facilitates deep reading, critical thinking, and social knowledge construction. Core Philosophy: The application must replace the "Screen Inferiority Effect" (shallow processing) with "Intentional Friction" and "Cognitive Visibility," slowing the reader down to ensure deep comprehension.

2. UX/UI Design Specifications
Directive: Design for "Digital Weight" and "Tactile" interaction.
Visual Aesthetic:
Palette: "Warmly Academic." Avoid pure white. Default background color: Cream (#FDFBF7) to reduce eye strain.
Typography: High-legibility Serif for body text (authority/comfort balance). Max line length of 50–75 characters; 1.5x leading.
Accessibility: Native "OpenDyslexic" font option and "Bionic Reading" mode (bolding first letters of words).
Navigation Structure:
Pagination over Scroll: Default to a paginated layout to create "micro-pauses" and restore "mental mapping" of information location.
Structural Timeline: Replace the scrollbar with a visual timeline showing chapter breaks and the user's own annotation markers.
Layout Architecture:
Dual-Canvas: Primary text on the left; "Thinking Sidebar" permanently open on the right for cognitive work.
Focus Mode: A "Deep Work" toggle that fades all non-essential chrome (menus, social counters), leaving only text and annotation tools.

3. Functional Requirements: The Temporal Architecture
The application must adapt its interface across three distinct reading phases.
Phase I: Before Reading (The "Entry Airlock")
Goal: Activate schema and set purpose.
Feature: The Airlock Modal: Users must pass through this screen before accessing the text.
Digital K-W-L: Input fields for "What I Know" and "What I Want to know." Inputs are pinned to the Thinking Sidebar.
Visual Priming: Display a "Word Cloud" or single evocative image related to the theme; prompt user for 3 association words.
Scavenger Hunt: Display a blurred version of the text where only headings and images are sharp. User must click 3 "clues" to unlock the full text.
Phase II: During Reading (The "Active Toolbelt")
Goal: Monitor comprehension and construct meaning.
Feature: Interactive Annotation:
Double-Entry Journal: Highlighting text triggers a "What do you think?" prompt, visually linking the text to the user's note.
QAR Tagging: Questions must be tagged as "Right There," "Think and Search," or "Author and You".
Feature: Speed Bumps:
"Notice and Note" Interstitials: Insert mandatory pause points in long texts (e.g., a blur effect) requiring a metacognitive check-in (e.g., "What was the main idea?") to proceed.
Feature: The "Fix-Up" Button:
A "Help, I'm Stuck" button offers strategies: "Re-read previous sentence," "Look up word," or "Read ahead".
Phase III: After Reading (The "Synthesis Dashboard")
Goal: Consolidation and extension.
Feature: The GIST Generator: Prompt user to summarize the section in 20 words or less (strict character limit enforced).
Feature: 3-2-1 Reflection: Structured input for 3 things learned, 2 interesting details, 1 remaining question.
Feature: K-W-L Reconciliation: Re-surface the "Want to know" list from Phase I and ask "What did you Learn?".

4. Social & Collaborative Architecture
Directive: Transform text into a conversation using "Reciprocal Teaching" roles, avoiding unstructured noise.
Annotation Layer:
Heatmaps: Visualize class activity via background shading (darker = more activity) to signal complex passages without clutter.
Channel Filters: Toggles for "Self," "Group," "Class," and "Instructor" views.
Role-Based Collaboration (Reciprocal Teaching 2.0): Assign users specific roles that unlock unique UI buttons:
The Questioner: "Ask" button pins questions to the top of the group stream.
The Clarifier: Access to integrated dictionary/encyclopedia lookup tools.
The Summarizer: Dedicated text box to draft group consensus summaries.
The Predictor: Prompted at chapter breaks to vote on upcoming plot/argument directions.

5. Gamification & Differentiation Engine
Directive: Leverage Self-Determination Theory (Autonomy, Competence, Relatedness).
Competence Visualization:
Skill Trees: Replace "percentage complete" with a profile tracking literacy skills (e.g., "Vocabulary Hunter" level up after 10 dictionary lookups).
Interactive Agency:
Branching Scenarios: Support Twine-like structures where user decisions change the narrative path (e.g., historical simulations).
Hexagonal Thinking: A drag-and-drop workspace to link key terms/themes; connecting tiles prompts a "Justify the Connection" text box.
Differentiation (AI-Powered):
Relatability Engine: AI rewrites introductions/examples to match user interests (e.g., using soccer metaphors for physics).
Lexile Toggle: Real-time slider to adjust text complexity/vocabulary for accessibility.
Fading Scaffolding: "Novice Mode" (high prompts, sentence starters) vs. "Expert Mode" (minimal UI).

6. Multimodal Creation Studio
Directive: Move beyond the essay; support "Creating Actively Across Contexts".
Inline Media: Video/Audio plays inside the text paragraph, floating to the side.
Podcast Studio: Integrated audio recorder/trimmer for students to record "interviews" or reflections.
Visual One-Pager: Canvas to drag-and-drop images, quotes, and icons for visual summarization.
